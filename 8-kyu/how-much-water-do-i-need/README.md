You are given a <code>clothes</code> amount of clothes to wash.  For each single item of clothes above the load, the washing machine will use 10% more water (multiplicative) to clean.</p><p>For example, if the load is <code>10</code>, the amount of water it requires is <code>5</code> and the amount of clothes to wash is <code>14</code>, then you need <code>5 * 1.1 ^ (14 - 10)</code> amount of water.</p><p>Write a function <code>howMuchWater</code> (JS)/<code>how_much_water</code> (Python and Ruby) to work out how much water is needed if you have a <code>clothes</code> amount of clothes.  The function will accept 3 arguments: - <code>water</code>, <code>load</code> (or <code>max_load</code>in Ruby) and <code>clothes</code>.</p><p>My washing machine is an old model that can only handle double the amount of <code>load</code> (or <code>max_load</code>).  If the amount of <code>clothes</code> is more than 2 times the standard amount of <code>load</code> (<code>max_load</code>), return <code>'Too much clothes'</code>.  The washing machine also cannot handle any amount of clothes less than <code>load</code> (<code>max_load</code>).  If that is the case, return <code>'Not enough clothes'</code>.</p><p>The answer should be rounded to the nearest 2 decimal places.</p>
