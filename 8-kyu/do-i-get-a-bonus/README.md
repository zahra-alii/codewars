The fatcats are rubbing their paws in anticipation... but who is going to make the most money? </p><p>Build a function that takes in two arguments (salary, bonus). Salary will be an integer, and bonus a boolean.</p><p>If bonus is true, the salary should be multiplied by 10. If bonus is false, the fatcat did not make enough money and must receive only his stated salary.</p><p>Return the total figure the individual will receive as a string prefixed with "£" (= <code>"\u00A3"</code>, JS, Go, Java, Scala, and Julia), "$" (C#, C++, Dart, Ruby, Clojure, Elixir, PHP, Python, Haskell, and Lua) or "¥" (Rust).</p>
