Fix the helper function they wrote so that it works as intended (i.e. it must make the first character in the string upper case).</p><p>The string will always start with a letter and will never be empty.</p><p>Examples:</p><pre><code>"hello" --&gt; "Hello""Hello" --&gt; "Hello" (the first letter was already capitalized)"a"     --&gt; "A"</code></pre>
